    "Abstract": "This dataset comprises resting state high density EEG data (64 or 128 channels) collected from three categories of subjects: amputees with phantom limb pain, amputees without phantom limb pain, and intact, pain free controls. The data has been organised accroding to the BIDS standard for more accesible reuse. Recordings are approximately 7 minutes long with eyes opened or closed, as indicated by task.",
